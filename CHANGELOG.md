New in 0.2.0
=============

* Feature name shown on features. Use option `gffNameAttr` to choose which GFF attribute to use to
get name from. Now the display of feature tracks is more informative.

* Option `squash` to collapse feature with the same coordinates.

* Feature track titles display the `showRegex` and `hideRegex` (so you know what you are filtering).
